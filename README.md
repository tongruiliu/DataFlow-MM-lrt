DataFlow series is a data preparation and training system designed to **parse, generate, process, and evaluate** high-quality data from noisy sources (PDF, plain-text, low-quality QA), thereby improving the performance of large language models (LLMs) in specific domains through targeted training (Pre-training, Supervised Fine-tuning, RL training) or RAG using knowledge base cleaning. 

Specifically, we are constructing diverse `operators` leveraging rule-based methods, deep learning models, LLMs, and LLM APIs. These operators are systematically integrated into distinct `pipelines`, collectively forming the comprehensive `DataFlow system`. Additionally, we develop an intelligent `DataFlow-agent` capable of dynamically assembling new `pipelines` by recombining existing `operators` on demand.

DataFlow-MM is the multimodal extension version of the awesome repo [DataFlow](https://github.com/OpenDCAI/DataFlow)


## Quick Start

### Installation

First, clone the repository and install **DataFlow-MM** in editable mode:

```bash
cd ./DataFlow-MM
conda create -n dataflow-mm python=3.12
conda activate dataflow-mm
pip install -e .
```

#### Optional Dependencies

Install additional dependencies based on your use case:

**Audio environment**

```bash
pip install -e ".[audio]"
```

**Image environment**

```bash
pip install -e ".[image]"
```

---

### Initialize a DataFlow Workspace

Create and initialize a DataFlow-MM workspace:

```bash
mkdir test_dataflow
cd test_dataflow
dataflowmm init
```

This command will generate the basic directory structure and configuration files required to run DataFlow-MM pipelines.

### Demo Data

To run the **Image** or **Video** examples, please download the corresponding demo datasets from Hugging Face (GitHub is not suitable for hosting large files):

* **Image Examples**:
  [https://huggingface.co/datasets/OpenDCAI/dataflow-demo-image](https://huggingface.co/datasets/OpenDCAI/dataflow-demo-image)

* **Video Examples**:
  [https://huggingface.co/datasets/OpenDCAI/dataflow-demo-video](https://huggingface.co/datasets/OpenDCAI/dataflow-demo-video)

* **Audio Examples**:
  [https://huggingface.co/datasets/OpenDCAI/dataflow-demo-audio](https://huggingface.co/datasets/OpenDCAI/dataflow-demo-audio)

* **Image Generation Examples**:
  [https://huggingface.co/datasets/OpenDCAI/dataflow-demo-image-gen](https://huggingface.co/datasets/OpenDCAI/dataflow-demo-image-gen)

After downloading, place the data in the "test_dataflow/example" directory as instructed in each example.
